  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Cairo
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/font/Cairo-Regular.ttf
        - asset: assets/font/Cairo-SemiBold.ttf
        - asset: assets/font/Cairo-Medium.ttf
        - asset: assets/font/Cairo-Bold.ttf
        - asset: assets/font/Cairo-Light.ttf
        - asset: assets/font/Cairo-ExtraBold.ttf
        - asset: assets/font/Cairo-ExtraLight.ttf
